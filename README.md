# I had imported the House Sale Price data, explored it a bit using descriptive statistics,
created some charts and did some simple calculations with the data. 
From this module onwards, our journey of real machine learning begins
where we are going to learn to build different ML models.Here the Sale Price is our Target
Variable (or dependent variable) and house characteristics are independent variables on which 
the sales price of a house may depend.
Since we have a target variable for this model, this is an example of supervised learning as we have learnt earlier 
And since our target variable is a numeric continuous variable, we will build a linear regression model which we will 
cover in greater detail subsequently.
So, our problem statement is to build a linear regression model to predict the sale price of a house based on its characteristics.
